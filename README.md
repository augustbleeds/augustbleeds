# About me üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm a seasoned backend/fullstack (do it all) engineer turned smart contract developer. 

- Currently working on launching my NFT collection
- I recently graduated from the [0xMacro](https://0xmacro.com/) fellowship, where I honed in my web3 skills building and auditing smart contracts
  - see https://github.com/augustjest/solidity-projects for what I've built (LPs, DAOs, ICOs, etc.)
